you must know that the nrf24 is super sensetive to noise even wifi
the ideal setup is a noiseless and open area
for the powering:
you have to use 3.3v regulator for the gnd and vcc pins also you have to use a 1000uf capacitor to prevent powershortage
also have in mind that the other pins are 5v tolerant
